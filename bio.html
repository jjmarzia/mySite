  <p>I am a 1st year Aerospace Engineering PhD student at Buffalo, advised by <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/mechanical-aerospace/people/faculty/j-chen.html">James Chen</a> and <a href="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~davidsal/">David Salac</a>. I am currently working on the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2022/04/025.html">LIFT project</a> at the UB Multiscale Computational Physics Lab (MCPL). I previously studied Physics (B.S. '22) and Mathematics (B.A. '22) at Roberts Wesleyan University, supervised by Candice Fazar and Gary Raduns.
