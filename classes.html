  <p>I am currently developing typeset versions of notes I take for my classes. They are a work in progress, so much of what is contained in the table of contents is incomplete.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuum mechanics - mathematical preliminaries, kinematics of deformable bodies, conservation and balance laws, thermodynamics of continua, constitutive relations, heat conduction in rigid solids, and mechanical theory of solids and fluids. </li>
  <li>Engineering analysis notes - linear algebra, ODEs, Fourier analysis, and PDEs </li>
</ul>
