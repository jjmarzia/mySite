  <p>I am currently developing typeset versions of notes I take for my classes. They are a work in progress, so much of what is contained in the table of contents is incomplete. Still, I thought that they might be helpful to myself and maybe to others. So hopefully I can finish them during break.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="notes/jjmarzia_mae555.pdf">Continuum mechanics</a>. Mathematical preliminaries, kinematics of deformable bodies, conservation and balance laws, thermodynamics of continua, constitutive relations, heat conduction in rigid solids, and mechanical theory of solids and fluids. </li>
  <li><a href="notes/jjmarzia_mae507.pdf">Engineering analysis</a>. Linear algebra, ODEs, Fourier analysis, and PDEs. </li>
  <li>Finite element analysis. 1-D Euler-Bernoulli beam theory; 2-D constant strain triangle (CST), 2-D isoparametric (QUAD4) and 3-D isoparametric (HEX8) elements. </li>
</ul>
