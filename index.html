  <br>
  <div>I am a second year PhD candidate in aerospace engineering with a concentration in continuum physics and applied mathematics at the University at Buffalo under the advisement of <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/mechanical-aerospace/people/faculty/j-chen.html">James Chen</a> and <a href="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~davidsal/">David Salac</a>. Currently I am a member of the Multiscale Computational Physics Lab working on the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2022/04/025.html">LIFT project</a>. Previously I studied physics (BS '22) and mathematics (BA '22) at Roberts Wesleyan College under the supervision of <a href="https://www.rit.edu/directory/cmfsps-candice-fazar">Candice Fazar</a> and <a href="https://www.roberts.edu/facultystaff/gary-l-raduns/">Gary Raduns</a>. </div>

  <h3>Resources</h3>
<ul>  
<li>While studying for my PhD qualifying exams, I developed <a href="notes.html">typeset versions of my notes.</a>  Topics include continuum mechanics, engineering analysis (a survey of ODEs, PDEs, Fourier analysis, and linear algebra), finite element analysis, and elasticity. Thankfully, with their help, I passed. So, feel free to use them. I will try to finish them by the end of 2023. </li>

  <h3>Personal</h3>
<ul>  
<li>In my undergrad I competed in <a href="https://robertsredhawks.com/sports/mens-soccer/roster/joseph-marziale/3631"> soccer</a> and <a href="https://robertsredhawks.com/sports/mens-indoor-track/roster/joseph-marziale/3881">track</a> at the NCAA DII level. I was also a resident advisor, a staff writer for the school newspaper, a member of the local Society of Physics Students chapter, a volunteer for the Student Multicultural Advisory Council, and class president. The college asked me questions about my experience so <a href="https://www.roberts.edu/news?id=5647">I responded</a>.</li>  
  <br>
  <li>I attend <a href="https://www.h2obuffalo.net/">H2O, a nondenominational church that does service on UB campus.</a> I highly recommend attending once if you have questions or are otherwise interested in the teachings of Jesus. There is always Sunday service in SU 330 at 10:30am and then a Bible study in Baldy 101 at 7pm. Usually there are one or two other midweek events. Also, here is an <a href="bible/b/index.htm"> online Bible</a> that I think is easy to use.</li>
  <br>
  <li>My wife, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alayna-marziale-161650218/">Alayna Marziale</a>, is an actuarial analyst for <a href="https://www.bpas.com/">BPAS</a>.</li>
<br>
<li>I was born in July 2001. With great pride I report that the number one song on the radio at that time was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxau9B3jOHM&t=3s">U Remind Me by Usher</a>.</li>
